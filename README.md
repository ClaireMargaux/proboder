## Installation

Installing R: https://cran.r-project.org/

Installing RStudio: https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio/

## Usage

Infer the contact rate from public health data using a SEIR(D) model. Inference through a state-space model using Gauss-Markov priors and (extended) Kalman filtering for the prediction and update steps.

## Data

Data from the Covid-19 Switzerland Dashboard of the Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH):
- COVID19Cases_geoRegion.csv: Daily recording schedules by geographical region for cases, from 24 February 2020 to 1 January 2023.
- COVID19Death_geoRegion_w.csv: Weekly recording timelines by geographical region for cases, from 24 February 2020 to 1 January 2023.
